# Azure Quantum Service Samples

These samples demonstrate how to run Q# programs on the Azure Quantum service:

- **[Grover's search](./grover)**:
  This sample shows how to run Grover's search algorithm using quantum hardware.
- **[Hidden shfit](./hidden-shift)**:
 This sample shows how to learn the hidden shift of bent Boolean functions using quantum hardware.
- **[Parallel QRNG](./parallel-qrng)**:
  This sample shows how to sample random numbers in parallel using quantum hardware.
- **[Ising model simulation](./ising-model)**:
  This sample shows how to simulate the time evolution of an Ising model using quantum hardware.
- **[Teleportation](./teleport)**:
  This sample shows how to run quantum teleportation on quantum hardware.
- **[Iterative Phase Estimation](./iterative-phase-estimation)**:
  This sample uses iterative phase estimation to estimate the inner product of a specified pair of 2-d vectors. It is compatible with basic measurement feedback targets.
